     - At first, I will not do only happy songs, I just do a song I find when browsing spotify or requested songs. But let's go. <br>
     - Artist: Alec Benjamin <br>
     - Album: Narrated for you <br>
     - Released: 4 June 2018 <br>
     - genre: Pop <br>
     - Song duration: 2 minutes and 49 seconds <br>
     - I think this is the song Alec Benjamin did break through with. Altough it is sad it got me through hard times. <br>
     - Rating: 9.8/10 <br>
     - The rating is because of how much this song means for me. <br>
