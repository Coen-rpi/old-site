            <p>
                Hi I am Coen. I am a 16 years young guy from the Netherlands. I like tech, games, football (I am a PSV fan) and I also like listening to music. <br>
                I have a lot of fun messing with PC's, I like the hardware side of PC's the most but also like the software side, especially making websites such as this one. I am not an expert in hardware, nor software. <br> 
                My interest in tech, mainly computers started with gaming, when I was even younger than I am now, I played games on a Nintendo DSI (I think it was a DSI lite.). I also did play games on the WII. But as I grew older my interests in tech/computers started to grow. <br> <br>
                In the covid pandemic and the lockdown, school started to be online and we got a chromebook, which when I did not have classes I started watching YouTube on, where I pretty quickly started watching gaming video's but also video's about custom PC's and Raspberry Pi.
                That was pretty much the start of my computers interests. When I found out about Linux I started to look for "Beginner friendly disto's" and after some time I found my parents old laptop with a Celeron N3050 and when I was allowed to use it to try out Linux I did. It was a short time with that laptop though, as I thought the HDD died because it wouldn't boot anymore.
                Soon after I bought a Raspberry Pi 4b 4GB, that also was a short time as I tought it was dead, but I found out that it wasn't after I sent it back. I think it was 4/5 months later where I realised the Micro-HDMI adapter probably died and not the Pi itself, as the seller told the Pi worked at them (But I got my money back so I did not have that Pi anymore).
                In what I think was 1 and a half to 2 years time, I did not have any desktop or laptop. I gamed on my Xbox Series S and had my phone. That was until I had already worked for like nearly a year, and I was finaly allowed to buy a gaming PC, the gaming PC I use nearly every day now.
                I already did know a little bit about homelabs and such. bBut when I got the Game PC I found out about homelabs. Roughly 1 year after I bought my gaming PC I got a HP Elitedesk with a Ryzen 5 PRO 2400G (Which recently died) and started my homelab journey. I learnt pretty much a lot of Linux basics (Debian/Ubuntu) earlier with VM's so setting it up was pretty easy for me.
                Before my old server died I bought some PC parts as I did already have a case, SSD and HDD and PSU. I bought an i3 7100, motherboard and CPU cooler. With my new server I now have acces to add more disks and I soon want to add a 1TB drive to be able to setup RAID or atleast some kind of backup. 
                I bought a PC from 2008 which I now use for Linux with a desktop sometimes. I made a YouTube video about it, you can find that <a href="https://youtu.be/PW05v0J_3Ss">here.</a> <br>
                So right now I am really interested in building PC's, Linux, homelabs and computers in general.

            <p>
                I listened a lot of music since I was young. I always have like Pop-music a lot. I started listening on MP3-players. Nowdays I have Spotify Premium and listen from my Phone/PC. Since this year I listen a lot of Olivia Rodrigo but I also like Dutch-Pop music (Nederpop) a lot.
                I did cover songs on my site. You can find them in the songs part of my site in the navigation bar.
